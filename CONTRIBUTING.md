# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, make sure to open an issue if not exist so we can discuss the problem.

## Requirements:

- CMake 3.12 or higher.
- C/C++ compilers.



## Instructions:

1. If there is an open issue for the specific problem that you want to solve, tell us in the same issue to assign you or you can open a new issue if there is none. 
2. Fork it to your account.
3. Clone it.
4. Create a new branch.
5. Solve the problem.
6. Commit with a descriptive message and the issue number #issue_number to your created branch.
7. Push the branch to your forked repo.
8. Create a pull request to upstream/master.
9. Stay around the PR so we can have a nice discussion if required.



## Naming Convention:

#### Snake case for:

- Functions `function_name()`

#### Camel case for:

- - Local variables `lengthOfString`

- Arguments `charLength`



## Restrictions:

- This repository is for educational purposes, any built-in functions are not allowed, so we can write the algorithm to solve the problem to learn.

- Compilation unit *.c is self-contained and should not rely on any other functions so people can refer to one file to learn the specific problem solution.

- Problem should be solved using `C`, tests can be written in `C++` because we are using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as testing framework.
